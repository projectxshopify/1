              <h2> Defining my scope </h2>

              <p> Three Ships Beauty is an ecommerce skincare startup that has grown rapidly in the last 4 years in business. As a Canadian DTC brand trying to increase more US awareness, my role was to conduct user interviews in order to optimize the Shopify e-commerce website and identify pain points from a customer standpoint. </p>

              <p> <b> The primary goals of this research is to: </b></p>

              <ul>
                <li> Understand pain points throughout the website -> Why are customers abandonning their carts? </li>

            <h2>Problem space</h2>

            <p> When I was looking at customer shopping behaviours on Google Analytics, I found out that almost 50% of users abandon their carts and almost 60% of users abandon their carts at check-out. Studies have shown that on average, 3/4 customers leave e-commerce websites without completing their purchases. Despite the fact that this means that our e-commerce website is performing above average, I knew that there was certainly room for improvement and I was determined to learn which pain points trigger users to abandon their carts.</p>

             <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
             <p> I kickstarted my research by doing an analysis of our biggest competitors' ecommerce websites. Although there is an abundance of various skincare brands out there, I decided to research these 4 skincare companies specificially, as they have similar brand values and coexist in the natural, clean and sustainability-driven space within the beauty industry. Through this analysis, my goals were to understand current trends and reassess the features I had envisioned for our website's redesign. </p>

             <h3> Key takeaways </h3>

             <ul>
                <li> Our competitors are doing a great job of putting in the effort to educate customers as much as possible on their pillar brand values such as sustainability, natural ingredients, how/when to use products etc. </li>
                <li> Not always successful at doing so, a good chunk of information is typically crammed in the PDP, not broken up into digestable pieces </li>
                <li> Often lacks in displaying brand values on the home page, not giving consumers an impactful first impression about the brand </li>

             <h6> RESEARCH</h6>

             <h2 class ="small">There’s a lack of guidance on making educated shopping decisions</h2>

             <p> I ran a wide-range user survey of our current e-commerce website to better empathize with our existing consumer base and understand pain points that might lead users to abandon their carts. I lead the primary research of our target audience which included 213 female Three Ships Beauty customers within our target demographic, ages 20-50. When I asked the users what kind of improvements they would like to see on our new website, the following 3 pain points came up repeatedly.</p>

          </figure>

            <h3>Current user journey map</h3>

             <p> In the current user flow, there is a lack of guidance for customers to learn how to establish a skincare routine or a gateway to discover new products. Products are rather listed like a marketplace and it's the customers' responsibility to do their own research on what products they want in their skincare regimen. 40% of the users I interviewed felt like they still had to do research on their own before purchasing our products.</p>

            <figure>

             <figcaption> Customer journey map created with user interview insights </figcaption>
           </figure>

            <h3 class ="small"> Customers need to do their own research on skincare</h3>
            <p> My research findings indicate that the current PDP overflows with important information about the ingredients, but it doesn't detail any instructions on how to layer which product in what sequence. This not only takes away the customers' opportunities to make educated shopping decisions, but also prevents them from discovering products they are missing in their skincare regimen.</p>

              <figcaption> Current PDP lacks information/ instructions on how to layer products </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3 class ="small"> Out of stock items </h3>
            <p> One of the common insights in our survey is that people hold off their purchases because the items they are looking for are out of stock. During the user interviews, customers mentioned that there is an inconvenient navigation system and it's hard to go back and forth between product pages. This is especially a bigger issue for our brand since we don't have many SKUs to begin with and a lot of our product pages typically have only 2-6 products. This in conjunction with the prevalence of out of stock issues, in product pages like the "cream" page where the only product in display is out of stock, customers are faced with a blank page (dead end), a common drop-off point on the site.</p>

              <img src = "img/empty.png" alt= "empty collections page" width = "800">
              <figcaption> Only product in the collections page sold out </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> After gathering all the insights from this research, I created a user persona which reflects our customers' needs, frustrations and goals. The lack of information and shopping guidance on our products are the primary pain points Lisa has. </p>

        <div class = "main-item">

          <h2> Breaking down the problem</h2>
          <p> My biggest takeaway from the user surveys and interviews is the fact that there is an overall lack of information about our products, especially in the product detail pages. While our current PDP is overloaded with great information about the ingredients (i.e. a section with the full list of ingredients), there is a lack of information on when & how to use the product, product combination suggestions, which products are suited for which skin types. This not only forces users to spend extra time to do their research on our products that should be readily available but ultimately prevents users from discovering new products to buy. Shopify statistics show that oftentimes, customers hold off their purchase if they don't meet the free shipping threshold of $50 which means that if they don't find 2-3 products to buy, they are likely not going to purchase at all.  </p>

          <figcaption> Current problem cycle at Three Ships </figcaption>
        </figure>

           <h3> Customers shouldn't have to do a whole lot of research </h3>
            <p> Even if they aren't considered as #skintellects, customers are increasingly becoming curious and eager to learn more about the products they are purchasing. In the vast expense of skincare diversification, I came to the realization that skincare is not as intuitive for most users and it's important to identify where our products ideally belong in a skincare regimen. Besides all our incredible information about the ingredients, customers want to know exactly when and how to use the products. </p>

           <h3> The Skincare Quiz is not enough! </h3>
            <p> Up until now, our e-commerce website heavily relied on the skin quiz to give customers product recommendations and assumed it would continue to keep customers happy. Although the Skincare Quiz is undoubtedly an amazing tool for first-time users to get product recommendations and increase conversion rates, it can't be the only feature we rely on to make a one-time product recommendation. The quiz has its constraints as it takes time to complete and it's likely going to generate the same 3 product recommendations each time the customer takes the quiz.</p>

          <h2> Addressing customer pain points</h2>

          <p> In order to address the most prevalent pain point which is the fact that there's an overall lack of information on how to use our products which not only takes away the customers' opportunities to make educated shopping decisions, but also prevents them from discovering products they are missing in their skincare regimen. I brainstormed ways to create a more curated shopping experience and allow them to make the most educated shopping decisions based on the given information, instead of displaying a page full of products. </p>

          <h3> Establishing a skincare routine </h3>
          <p> Customers can directly navigate on their own and discover products categorized in different steps in a skincare routine. When designing this section, I put an emphasis on reusing the dedicated inner + outer packaging colours used for each product line (i.e. pink for all serums) for continuity to ensure that users can quickly recognize the product line and associate it to the order of routine. </p>

          <figure>

            <figcaption> Guiding customers to establish a routine in the home page </figcaption>
         </figure>
 
          <h3> Easier navigation</h3>

          <p> Although internal manufacturing delays, resulting in out of stock items are out of my scope, I wanted to brainstorm ways to create meaningful shopping experiences, even when the only product in the collections page is out of stock. Currently, when an item is out of stock in the products page, the user has to go back to the navigation bar and go through a tedious process of selecting another page to navigate to which requires multiple steps. I wanted to facilitate the navigation process to ensure that customers can easily navigate to a different collections page, instead of dropping off. By adding a sub navigation bar, users have more flexibility in terms of navigating between collections pages, extending the browsing time and having a more pleasant shopping experience. </p>

          <figure>
            <img src = "img/sub.png" alt= "Sub navigation bar" width = "800">
            <figcaption> Sub navigation bar in the collections pages to facilitate navigation process </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3> Labelling each step </h3>

          <p> This hover section explains what step of the skincare routine the products displayed belong in and differentiates the products within the page as not all serums are the same (i.e. explains the difference between water-based and oil-based serums and when they should be applied for optimal results in a skincare regimen). The products pages is the ideal spot to explain that not all serums are the same because information should be broken up into digestable pieces so that customers are not overwhelmed with paragraphs after paragraphs of information in the PDP.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src = "img/products.png" alt= "Labelling steps" width = "800">
            <figcaption> Labelling each step of the skincare routine on the hover section </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3> Emphasizing continuity </h3>

          <p> Something that I’ve been trying to emphasize in order to help users navigate through the site more easily, is putting capitalizing on building a skincare routine by putting an emphasis on colour coordination and continuity (i.e. pink for serums) so that our site doesn’t feel like an amazon marketplace but rather, a highly curate ecommerce website that guides users every step of the way. Not only does this section further detail where exactly the product belongs in a skincare regimen and when to use it, adding this information adds credibility to our product and brand as whole, we could help our customers more insightful and informed purchases without overwhelming them with information in the PDP.  </p>

          </figure>

          <h3> A dedicated skincare FAQ page</h3>

          <p> While doing my competitive analysis, I noticed that a lot of the FAQ pages of the skincare brands I researched were often hard to follow and crammed with a large variety of information, never one dedicated solely to skincare education. As a skincare brand and the amount of pain points identified regarding not providing enough information on our products, I thought it was appropriate to create a dedicated skincare FAQ page. I collaborated with the operations intern to gather valuable skincare insights and took a visual approach when establishing the layout of this page to ensure that users don't have to read through paragraphs to learn about skincare. My team also decided to create a QR code to include in our product packaging that would direct them to this page.</p>

                <h2>Usability test</h2>

                <p> After designing diverging PDP prototypes, one of which includes a longer and more detail-oriented page with modules stacked on top of each other and one which is condensed into a carousel-like feature. I recruited 6 existing Three Ships Beauty customers ages 20-50 in our target demographic to collect feedback on my design decisions and test out the usability of the new hover feature in the product pages and decide which PDP layout works best at helping customers digest educational skincare content easily. </p>

                <h3> Test results </h3>
                <p> According to my interview insights, 6/6 users were in favour of having a hover effect which details about the different kinds of products we have, but didn't really have a preference for the PDP layouts. One of the feedback we got from the user testing is that it would be nice to compartmentalize the different kinds of products together so they can easily identify the product type. We implemented this feedback and categorized each product to its corresponding group. </p>

                <h3> Final mockup</h3>
                <p> The Lustre design agency made a final mockup of the hover feature and incorporated the feedback provided by users of compartmentalizing products by their type (i.e. displaying water based and oil based serums separately on the page).</p>

               <p>While I brainstormed creative solutions to the design problems we faced at Three Ships Beauty, I was afraid that my solutions would not be drastic enough to satisfy our customers and drive actual change. However, I realized that it's not always about how radical the product looks compared to the previous iteration and that the smallest tweak can make a big impact in enhancing the shopping experience of a customer. </p>
